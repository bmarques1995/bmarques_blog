summary: 'Build a C/C++ program can be tricky, you must configure makefiles for the project for unix systems or visual studio projects. How about delegate this task to CMake?'

## Building a C++ program

Consider that you must (or would like) build a C++ program, the steps tend to be easy, only create a `.cpp` file, create the main function, and call the program, like this:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello C++" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

The program is simple and will be run easily with:

`g++ -o sample sample.cpp`

So, here we have a small C++ program, and I can handle C++ projects, right?

Take it easy, my dear, I have two questions:

- How do you handle this project on Windows?
- How do you manage dependencies and include directories?

As long as the codebase grows, managing dependencies becomes harder, especially for importing new libraries.
And how do we solve this?

## Cross Platform Makefile Generator

The Cross Platform Makefile Generator or CMake, is a middleware to generate C/C++ project files, it easily generates and manages C++ projects for:

- Visual Studio
- Ninja
- Unix Makefiles
- NMake Makefiles
- XCode projects
- Others

It also manages libraries, compiling and linking them, making dependency management much easier.
Here is a sample CMake config.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)

project(Sample)

add_executable(Sample sample.cpp)
```

## Conclusion

CMake is a useful set to configure and compile a lot of C++ projects, between operating systems and config files, with a lot of famous cross-platform projects configured with it:

- Qt
- MySQL
- MySQL Connector
- Vulkan
- SDL
- DuckStation
- PCSX2
- Freetype
- WxWidgets

So, if you are thinking in start to learn C/C++, consider using cmake to manage your projects.
